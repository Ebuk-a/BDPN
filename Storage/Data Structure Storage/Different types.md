### 1. **Linear Structures → Sequential Storage**

* **Examples:**

  * **Array:** `[10, 20, 30, 40]` (structured)
  * **Linked List:** `10 → 20 → 30` (structured)
  * **Stack:** Browser back/forward navigation (structured)
  * **Queue:** Print job queue (structured)
* **Type:** **Structured** (since order and schema are well-defined)



### 2. **Non-linear Structures → Hierarchical or Networked Storage**

* **Examples:**

  * **Tree:** File system directory structure (`C:\Users\Documents\...`) (structured)
  * **Graph:** Social network (users as nodes, friendships as edges) (semi-structured, since relationships can be dynamic and flexible)
* **Type:**

  * Trees → Structured
  * Graphs → Semi-structured



### 3. **Hashing → Key-based Storage**

* **Examples:**

  * **Hash Table:** Dictionary in Python `{ "id": 1, "name": "Alice" }` (structured)
  * **Key-Value Store:** Redis, DynamoDB (can be semi-structured if values are JSON)
* **Type:** Structured or Semi-structured (depends on values stored)


### 4. **File-based → Raw Storage on Disk**

* **Examples:**

  * **Text file (TXT, CSV):** `"Name, Age\nAlice, 25"` (structured or semi-structured depending on formatting)
  * **Log file:** `2025-08-15 10:45:23 - Error at line 21` (semi-structured)
  * **Image file (JPEG, PNG):** Raw pixels (unstructured)
* **Type:** Can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured depending on content


### 5. **Databases → Structured Storage**

* **Examples:**

  * **Relational DB:** SQL Server, MySQL (tables with rows/columns → structured)
  * **Document DB:** MongoDB, CouchDB (JSON/XML documents → semi-structured)
  * **Key-Value DB:** Redis, DynamoDB (semi-structured if values vary)
  * **Columnar DB:** Cassandra, BigQuery (structured, optimized for analytics)
* **Type:** Structured or Semi-structured depending on model



Would you like me to also include **real-world examples** (like how Facebook, Amazon, or Google use these) so it’s easier to relate to?
